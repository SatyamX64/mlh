The Journey to Hospital is not something we all look forward to, but no matter how much we dread it, we just can’t avoid it. 
More  often than not, we end up with a bunch of Medicines and remembering how much and how often to eat them can be indeed very daunting. 
So the only option that remains is writing it all up in a paper, or being a Memory Champion. Unfortunately none of them is very suitable and viable for all. 

The optimal solution (with least chance of errors) is noting all the details when the Medical Store Guy is telling us. 
But standing with a Notepad and writing everything along as he speaks can be a little challenging. 
So we decided to lift that burden off your back and digitalize the Process. 

Using our system, the Medical Store guy, can directly enter all the consumption details while billing up your medicines. 
Since computers are not so popular in local Medical Shops we decided to make all this work in a simple App.
Once all the data is filled by the Medical Store Guy he will simply send it to the Customer’s app, and that App will send the User regular notification whenever its time to consume Medicine. 

Let’s clear the WorkFlow in a simple step by step process  :-
========================================================================
A.Doctor writes the Prescription and hands it to you
B.You hand that over to the Medical Store guy
C.He scans that Bill from his Mobile App and using a Text Recognition system we extract details (common details like Medicine name,quantity, specified timings etc, i.e the details which are generally listed in prescription)  
  out of the Bill and directly put them on the Billing Screen.
D.The Medical Store guy will then fill in the missing fields.(Like Price,which is not mentioned in prescription and varies from store to store) and also rectify any details that our Text Recognition system got wrong. 
  In addition to all this he will also click a picture of all the Medicines while billing them. (or he can just use them from a existing database)
E. Once he fills in all the Details and generates the Bill, then our system will generate a regular bill, but in addition to that it will also have a QR Code (which more or less contains all the data of that bill)
F. Now our Consumer will open his app and scan that QR code. That way all his medicine’s info will get stored in his App. Now he can easily keep track of all his medicines. 
   On Top of that he will also get regular Notifications whenever he has to consume his meds. (Based on the Data entered by the Medical Store Guy)

USP of Project : 
==============================
1. The Entire system will be seamless and hassle free for all parties
2. The Customer won't necessarily have to give his contact details to Medical Store guy, since our system uses QR Code. 
3. Apart from the regular Billing details, the Medical store guy only has to enter few more details (like when and how much to consume)
4. Since the Medical Store guy has himself added the Data, he won't have to repeat it to Customer like they generally do.Thus Saving the Time of Both the Customer and himself.
